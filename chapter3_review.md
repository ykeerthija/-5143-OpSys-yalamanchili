1.What does it mean to preempt a process?

Preemption with respect to the operating system means the ability of an operating system to stop or pause the scheduled task in order to gain higher priority task.

2.What is swapping and what is its purpose?

Swapping is mainly used to increase the utilization of the processor by moving the blocked processes from main memory to the secondary memory. By doing this, it forms a queue of temporarily suspended process and it continues the execution with the new process.
After the swapping is done, the operating system may choose the newly created process or may activate the already suspended process.

3.List three general categories of information in a process control block.

Process control block can also be called as task controlling block which is a data structure that is used in operating system kernel which contains the information that is required to manage the particular process.
The three main categories in process control block are as follows.
•	 Process identification data
•	Processor state data
•	Process control data

4.Why are two modes (user and kernel) needed?

The two modes (kernel and user) are needed because kernel mode needs direct access to hardware and reference memory, protection needed in user mode.

5.What is the difference between an interrupt and a trap?

An interrupt is something which is generated by the hardware and which is asynchronous. An interrupt handler is used to deal with the cause of the interrupt. Interrupts are caused by the independent instruction that is running in the processor.
A trap is a special kind of interrupt which is referred to as software interrupt. Traps are created by the execution of the current instruction and so they are referred as synchronous events.

6.Give three examples of an interrupt.

The three examples of an interrupt are as follows.
a.Internal interrupt
b. interrupt
c.Software interrupt

7.What is the difference between a mode switch and a process switch?

The process switch is nothing but when the process  switches from one process to another process.
The mode switch is used only when the CPU changes its levels. For example, if the kernel works at the higher privilege than the user, in order for the user to access things that are controlled by the kernel, it is necessary for a mode to switch.
